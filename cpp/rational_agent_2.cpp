// Here's an example of a simple rational agent without sensors implemented in C++:

#include <iostream>

// Function representing the agent's decision-making process
int rationalAgent(int environmentState)
{
    // Agent's logic for making decisions based on the environment state
    if (environmentState == 0)
    {
        return 1; // Take action 1
    }
    else
    {
        return 0; // Take action 0
    }
}

int main()
{
    // Assume the environment state is represented by an integer
    int environmentState = 0;

    // Call the rational agent function to make a decision
    int action = rationalAgent(environmentState);

    // Print the action chosen by the agent
    std::cout << "Agent chose action: " << action << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

// In this example, the rational agent takes an environment state as input and returns an action based on that state. The agent's decision-making logic is defined within the rationalAgent function, which takes an int parameter representing the environment state.

// In this simple example, the agent checks if the environment state is 0. If it is, the agent decides to take action 1; otherwise, it takes action 0.

// The main function in this code simulates the agent-environment interaction by calling the rationalAgent function with a specific environment state. The chosen action is then printed to the console.

// Note that this example assumes a basic agent that doesn't have sensors to perceive the environment directly. Instead, the environment state is passed as an input parameter to the agent's decision-making function.
